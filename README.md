## Einstein
Einstein is a Chrome Extension that adds the sick mode message to Einstein without being sick, allowing you to create custom messages in the message box. To install Einstein, download the Einstein folder, using Google Chrome, go to chrome://extensions, enable developer mode in the top right corner of the screen, click the "Load Unpacked" button in the top left, and navigate to the folder containing the files.

To create a custom message, open einstein.js with a text editor and change the string at the bottom of the file.
